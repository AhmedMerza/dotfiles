# Dotfiles

This repository contains my personal dotfiles for an optimized development environment, including configurations for **Zsh**, **Tmux**, and **Neovim**. It is tailored to work with my preferred tools and settings, providing a seamless experience across various development tasks.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following tools installed on your system before using these dotfiles:

- **Zsh**: The default shell (configured with Powerlevel10k, Oh My Zsh, and other plugins).
- **Tmux**: A terminal multiplexer for managing multiple terminal windows.
- **Neovim**: A modern text editor that is part of my development workflow.
- **Tmux Plugin Manager (TPM)**: Used to manage tmux plugins.
- **Powerlevel10k**: A Zsh theme for a fast and highly customizable prompt.
- **Zsh Plugins**: `zsh-autosuggestions`, `zsh-syntax-highlighting`, and others for enhanced user experience.

## Setup

### 1. Clone this repository

To get started, clone this repository into your home directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AhmedMerza/dotfiles.git ~
cd ~
```

### 2. Install plugins

Zsh Plugins: After setting up the .zshrc file, install Zsh plugins by running:

```bash
# Install Oh My Zsh if not already installed
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"

# Install Zsh plugins (e.g., zsh-autosuggestions, zsh-syntax-highlighting)
source ~/.zshrc
```

Tmux Plugins: After setting up tmux.conf, use Tmux Plugin Manager (TPM) to install the necessary plugins by starting a Tmux session and pressing prefix + I to install them.

```bash
# In your tmux session, press C-Space + I to install plugins
```

Neovim Plugins: Install plugins for Neovim using your Lazy.

```bash
# In Neovim, run :LazySync
```

### 3. Switch from Bash to Zsh

Now that the plugins and configurations are set up, switch to Zsh as your default shell:

```bash
# Change the default shell to Zsh
chsh -s $(which zsh)
```

Note: If youâ€™re using a system that requires sudo for user modifications, you may need to prepend sudo to the command above. Additionally, make sure you have Zsh installed on your system before changing the default shell.

Once the shell is changed, restart your terminal for Zsh to take effect.

### 4. Customize your environment

#### Zsh: Your Zsh prompt will use Powerlevel10k by default. You can customize it by running:

```bash
p10k configure
```

Tmux: Tmux is set up to use plugins such as tmux-resurrect, tmux-continuum, and others for an enhanced session management experience.

Neovim: The configuration is designed for modern development workflows, particularly for PHP (Laravel) and general programming tasks.
